请在 @README.md 文件顶部添加"中文"链接，点击后在当前浏览器页面打开中文版。中文版文件名请遵循常见命名规范。中文版内容暂时留空即可，我会用其他AI工具翻译后粘贴过来。但需确保中文版顶部有"English"链接，点击后在当前浏览器页面打开英文版README.md。

I'll help you add language links to the README files. Let me first read the current README.md to understand its structure.

Now I'll create the Chinese version file and add language links to both files. I'll use `README.zh-CN.md` as the filename, which follows the common naming convention for Chinese localization.

[2 tools called]

Perfect! I've completed the task:

1. **Created Chinese version file**: `README.zh-CN.md` following the common naming convention for Chinese localization
2. **Added language links**: 
   - At the top of `README.md`: "English | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)"
   - At the top of `README.zh-CN.md`: "[English](README.md) | 中文"

The Chinese version file is currently empty (except for the language navigation links) as you requested. You can now paste the translated content from your other AI tool whenever you're ready. The links will open the respective files in the current browser page.
